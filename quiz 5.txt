gamer algorithm lol

requirements:
length must be either 69 or 420
lol

char array:
linear search for each char 'g', 'a', 'm', 'e', 'r'.
chars are added into a final array.
if the final array doesnt contain all the characters, it returns -1.


number array:
adds each element to each other until it reaches 69 (haha funny number)
if the sum is greater than 69 the proceeding elements would be subtracted from the sum.

option 2 would be 420, (parameter is provided)
